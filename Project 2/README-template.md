## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I have understood how flex is working and what are its limitations. Also, got a pretty good grasp on how to use flex in order to create fluid layouts.

I have also tried to complete the challange by writting CSS as clear as possible and avoid unnecessary styling.


### Continued development

At this stage the focus is to continue building layouts and get rid of some of the frustration related to CSS.
