## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Pitfalls of using em everywhere - can cause undesirable results if not payed attention to
- I have understood how to use the repeat function together with minmax function
- A little bit of hover animation :)
- I still have some doubts on how I have centered the page in the middle of the browser window. Somehow it feels wrong and no easy to read.

### Continued development

I will continue to create small projects and add gradually more elements.
